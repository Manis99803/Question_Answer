# Question_Answer

So, I have tried to make a basic version of popular website "Quora".

Where a user can search for anything related to any topic ,if their search query matches with the data present in the data base we give them the answer, and if the search query is not present in the data base then user has the option to request the answer from other user who are using our app ,by just posting it on the on our app.[Search is case insensitive]

So next time when ever any other user logs into our app he will get a notification telling that "Somebody has asked some X qestion would you like to answer to the question" he will be having two option yes or no. So that he can either answer to the question asked by some random user X or just carry on with his work.

The other feature what we have in our program is 'Bookmark' ,we give the user to bookmark the topic of his choice which will be stored permanantly and wouldnt vanish when the program terminates .So by bookmark I mean you can bookmark any topic Ex:Java ,so now the bookmarked topic is Java so whenever someone post anything about Java you can go read about it in the Bookmark section of your app,You can bookmark anynumber of topic. To add more and more bookmark topic user have to just to go the bookmark section and write the topic name and click on add button. This is a queue implementaion

The next feature what we have is "History" you can view all your search histiory by just clicking on the History button you have two option either to clear the hisotry or view history.History in our program is dynamic ,during program execution user will have the option to delete the history but if the user doesnt clear his history on terminating the program it cleared by default.

One more feature what we have in our program is "Add data" by this feature you can add data to our data base by just filling the topic and description about it.

//Pre requisite to run the program 

Python3
Install tkinter (If Ubuntu user)

Before running the program make sure all the files By name "Bookmark.txt","Data.txt","Signup.txt","Question.txt" are present in the same folder in which the Search.py program is present
